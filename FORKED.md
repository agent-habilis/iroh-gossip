# Changes from upstream iroh-gossip

## `Disconnect::left` reuses the obsolete `_respond` field

`proto/hyparview.rs`: the second field of `Disconnect` was `_respond`, obsolete and always `false`.
It is now `left`. Postcard writes fields by position, so the bytes are the same. An old receiver
ignores it. Upstream releases before v0.90.0 sent `respond: true`, but they used a different
struct (one field), which a current peer cannot decode, so no decodable `Disconnect` ever had
`true` there.

If upstream changes this field, the merge conflicts here. Keep `left` and its meaning.
